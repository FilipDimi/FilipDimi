AI Software Engineer with 4+ years building scalable, production-grade systems powered by LLMs, real-time data infra, and secure cloud-native architecture. Currently serving as a Solutions Architect / Founding SWE at prompts.ai, where I lead engineering for an LLM platform.

I‚Äôve architected AI pipelines across AWS Bedrock, SageMaker, and Vertex AI, scaled multi-tenant backend systems, and led security initiatives that earned SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA, and GDPR compliance. I thrive in early-stage environments where shipping fast, owning infra, and mentoring other devs matter.

My academic work focused on Machine Learning (ML) for climate impact prediction on coffee (EcoBeanAI), real-time CV systems on GCP, and optimizing research workflows using PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and BigQuery.

üß† Core Skills: Go, Rust, Python, TypeScript, C/C++
‚öôÔ∏è Strengths: LLM infra, MLOps, CI/CD, backend architecture, secure API systems
üìå Open to: AI / GenAI Engineering, Full-Stack or Backend SWE, LLM Infrastructure, and Staff-level Engineering roles.

Let‚Äôs connect if you‚Äôre working on AI infrastructure or scaling high-performance backend systems.
